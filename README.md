### **Project Description**
Project Name: Intelli-Traffic

We know that, the population of cities and vehicles on the road is increasing rapidly. On account of this, controlling the roads have seamless traffic movement is major issue. Todayâ€™s traffic management system has no emphasis on live traffic scenario, which leads to inefficient systems. 
We are aiming to reduce the TRAFFIC DELAY TIME and thus also helping reduce CARBON EMISSIONS. We have made the model which makes use of weighted mean of : Congestion Coefficient & Live Location and Bearing Angle of approaching emergency vehicle from Nearest Traffic Signal.
We have implemented this in the form an Android Application and have made use of YOLO and Azure Cognitive Services for doing the same.
